Then one balmy, midsummer evening, a man happened to walk by. This man was, let’s just say, "not low". He got into the Crooked Dory, went ’round and ’round like you’d expect. But instead of getting frustrated, he laughed. And he wouldn’t stop. Legend says if you listen real quietly, you can still hear him, giggling in his Crooked Dory."',
